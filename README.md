# rcss

have you ever seen css and gone "wow i want to code a whole project in just that"?

well look no further! runnable css, or rcss is a language that uses only css keywords.
It takes the best part of the web-dev process and makes it something the whole family can enjoy!

### example

below is an example of the first 11 numbers of the fibonacci sequence

```css
.main {
	background-position: 1 1;
	background-color: #001;

	outline: 0 solid #00a;

	background-position: 2 1;
	border: 0 solid #001;

	background-position: 0 1;
	border: 1 none #000;

	background-position: 1 0;
	border: 2 none #000;

	padding-left: 35;
	padding-left: 58;
	padding-left: 32;
	padding-right: 0;
	padding-top: 0;

	overflow: auto;
}
```

## index

table of keywords and their usage

| keyword | usage |
|---------|-------|
| background-position \<index\> \<rewrite\> | selects the variable at \<index\>, assuming the first created is at index 0<br>the second arg is the rewrite type, 0 for nothing(if variable doesnt exist it is an integer)<br>1 for rewrite the variable to an integer<br>2 for rewrite the variable to a string |
| background-color \<color\> | sets the selected variable from `background-position` to the hexadecimal value in the color code<br>if the variable is a string, then the character with a matching ascii value to \<color\> is appended to the end |
| outline \<start\> \<type\> \<end\> | starts a loop starting from the \<start\> and ending at \<end\>, where \<start\> is a decimal value and \<end\> is hexadecimal. the type specifies how the loop is done, `solid` for a continuous loop with a step of positive 1 |
| overflow | the argument is ignored for now but is required to make the css look valid, defines the end of the loop |
| border \<var1\> \<op\> \<var2\> | will perform the mathematical operation \<op\> and store it in the selected variable.<br>ops:<br>`none` sub with rhs as literal<br>`hidden` sub with lhs as literal<br>`dotted` sub with two vars<br>`dashed` add with rhs as literal<br>`solid` add with 2 vars<br>`double` mult with rhs as literal<br>`groove` mult with 2 vars<br>`ridge` div with rhs as literal<br>`inset` div with lhs as literal<br>`outset` div with two vars<br> |
| padding-right \<var\> | appends variable to list for printing to stdout |
| padding-left \<ascii\> | appends the ascii character code to the list for printing, note that ascii characters are not given a space after the way variables are |
| padding-top \<amount\> | prints \<amount\> variables to stdout from the list generated by `padding-right`.<br>if \<amount\> is 0 or greater than total it prints all the variables |
