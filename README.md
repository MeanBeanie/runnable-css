# rcss

have you ever seen css and gone "wow i want to code a whole project in just that"?

well look no further! runnable css, or rcss is a language that uses only css keywords.
It takes the best part of the web-dev process and makes it something the whole family can enjoy!

### example

below is an example of the first 11 numbers of the fibonacci sequence

```css
.main {
	background-size: 3;

	background-position: 1 0;
	background-color: #001;

	outline: 0 solid #00a;

	background-position: 2 0;
	border: 0 solid #001;

	background-position: 0 0;
	border: 1 none #000;

	background-position: 1 0;
	border: 2 none #000;

	padding-right: 0;
	padding-top: 0;

	overflow: auto;
}
```

## index

table of keywords and their usage

| keyword | usage |
|---------|-------|
| background-size \<count\> | tell the interpreter that you want to create \<count\> variables, each set to 0 |
| background-position \<index\> | selects the variable at \<index\>, assuming the first created is at index 0, ignores second argument for now |
| background-color \<color\> | sets the selected variable from `background-position-x` to the hexadecimal value in the color code |
| outline \<start\> \<type\> \<end\> | starts a loop starting from the \<start\> and ending at \<end\>, where \<start\> is a decimal value and \<end\> is hexadecimal. the type specifies how the loop is done, `solid` for a continuous loop with a step of positive 1 |
| overflow | the argument is ignored for now but is required to make the css look valid, defines the end of the loop |
| border \<var1\> \<op\> \<var2\> | will perform the mathematical operation \<op\> and store it in the selected variable.<br>currently ops:<br>`solid` for addition<br>`none` for subtraction where the second input is treated as an integer literal, useful for assigning variables to other variables |
| padding-right \<var\> | appends variable to list for printing to stdout |
| padding-left \<ascii\> | appends the ascii character code to the list for printing, note that ascii characters are not given a space after the way variables are |
| padding-top \<amount\> | prints \<amount\> variables to stdout from the list generated by `padding-right`.<br>if \<amount\> is 0 or greater than total it prints all the variables |
